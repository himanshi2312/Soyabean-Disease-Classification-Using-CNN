# Soyabean Disease Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting plant diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is based on the InceptionV3 architecture and has been trained on a dataset of images containing various plant diseases.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Streamlit
- Pillow

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd plant-disease-detection
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Model

To run the model using Streamlit, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run Streamlit.py
```

This will start a Streamlit server and open a new tab in your web browser displaying the user interface for uploading images and making predictions.

## Model Evaluation

The model has been evaluated on a validation dataset to measure its performance in terms of loss and accuracy. The results are as follows:

- Validation Loss: [insert validation loss here]
- Validation Accuracy: [insert validation accuracy here]
